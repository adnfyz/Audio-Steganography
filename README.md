# Audio-Steganography
Low Bit Encoding(LBE) algorithm is used in which a text file is embedded into a Waveform file to hide the text and audio can be sent.
the code comprises of data structures used in java language.
The code first changes the characters of datafile into ASCII value and then to binary and the bits start embedding into the last bit of audio file.
at dsteganation side, the data is retrieved in the same way as in was steganated in first file
First File :steg.java
Second file: dsteg.java
